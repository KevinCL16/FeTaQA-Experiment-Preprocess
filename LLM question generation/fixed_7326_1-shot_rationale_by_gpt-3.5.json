From the table, we can see that there are multiple gminas listed, including Sierpc, Gmina Sierpc, Gmina Zawidz, Gmina Mochowo, Gmina Gozdowo, Gmina Szczutowo, and Gmina Rościszewo. The first column indicates the gmina names, the second column indicates the type (urban or rural), and the fourth column indicates the population in the year 2006.  To determine the composition of Sierpc county as of 2006, we need to sum up the populations of all the gminas listed in the table. By adding up the population numbers, we find that the total population of Sierpc County in 2006 was 53,811.  Additionally, the table specifies that the population of Sierpc (the urban gmina) was 18,791, and the populations of the rural gminas (Gmina Sierpc, Gmina Zawidz, Gmina Mochowo, Gmina Gozdowo, Gmina Szczutowo, and Gmina Rościszewo) totaled 35,020.
